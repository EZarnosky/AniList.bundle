## AniList Plex Metadata Agent

This plugin will allow you to use AniList metadata for a Plex library.

### Installation

- Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/sachaw/AniList.bundle/releases/latest).
- Move `AniList.bundle` to your Plex [plugins directory](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201106098-how-do-i-find-the-plug-ins-folder/).
- Restart Plex

### Usage

To use the agent, create a new library in Plex and select AniList as the metadata agent. There is a TV shows agent, and a movies agent.

I recommend using [Absolute Series Scanner](https://github.com/ZeroQI/Absolute-Series-Scanner/).
